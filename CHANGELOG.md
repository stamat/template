# Changelog

All notable changes to <project> are recorded here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and
the project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Contributing an entry

Write your change under `## [Unreleased]`, grouped under `### Added`,
`### Changed`, `### Fixed`, `### Deprecated`, `### Removed` or `### Security`.
Give the heading a short title after an em dash and open with one paragraph
saying what was wrong before:

```markdown
## [Unreleased] — timeouts are configurable

Every request used the same hardcoded thirty seconds, which is too long for a
health check and too short for an upload.

### Added

- ...
```

Write it for the person upgrading, not for the person who wrote the code. What
they need is what changed for them: a renamed option, a different default, an
error that is now thrown, output that moved.

On `script/publish`, `script/changelog` cuts this section into a released entry
in the same commit as the version bump, and the entry becomes the body of the
GitHub release verbatim.
